Book Store MERN Project 📚🚀
Overview
The Book Store MERN Project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This platform allows users to browse, order, and manage books, while admins have full control over book inventory and order management. The project features Redux Toolkit for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase Authentication for secure user login and signup (including Google authentication). Mongoose is used for efficient database operations with MongoDB.
